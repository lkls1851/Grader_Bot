Between 1995 and 2010, a study was conducted representing the percentages of
people born in Australia, versus people born outside Australia, living in urban,
 rural, and town. First, in 1995, cities represented the major percentage of
  habitat by roughly 50 percent, followed by rural areas and towns came in last,
   among people born in Australia. On the other hand, people born outside
    Australia, cities showed the most percentages of 6o percent, followed by
    rural areas and towns. In 2010, among people born in Australia, cities had
     an increase more than 20 percent increase in the total representation and
      a major decrease in towns and rural areas. Conversely, people born
       outside Australia, cities had the most percentage among both studies,
        followed by rural areas and towns.
